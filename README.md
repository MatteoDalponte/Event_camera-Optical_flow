# Optical flow and ego motion estimation of an event camera stream
University project based on event camera optical flow estimation using Python environment

The dataset used was taken on event-based data of University of Zurich:  http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/davis_data.html

The algorithm is based on the maximization of the variance of IWE (Image Warped Event) using simple algorithm and derivative based. 
No NN approach was attempted
